# Telecom-Churn-Case-Study
<h2>Problem statement:</h2>

In telecom industry, acquiring a new customer is 5-10 times more expensive than retaining an existing customers. In South Asian markets, the companies have a huge customer base who are on prepaid network and hence can move to another network without any prior notice/intimation. Therefore it is of great importance to telecom companies to identify the customers who are at high risk of leaving the network(i.e. getting CHURNED) so that the company can act(with promotional packages/discounts) before the customer actually leave them.
